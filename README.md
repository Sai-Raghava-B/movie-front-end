And if you want you can delete the List.

For accesing the public lists with a link u need to have the id  Of it  this the path for it "/public/:id"   As it is a front end application you will not see any id . If you wnat you can connect to the backend and add a console log in te react file to get the id and check it accordingly.

I will be sharing the backend part of it also. You can create a database and check for the id of list and try to access it.
